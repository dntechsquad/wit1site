          <p>
            Survivors completed an entire game. They endured the explosions, pitfalls into the abyss and razor sharp edges. For some, it took many tries. The people on this leader board made the top 10 times.

        <p>
          We’ve made a nifty graph that showcases Blocky’s spectacular deaths and counts how many blocks died at which point in the game. You can see which death trap is easy to surpass. Make it harder!
